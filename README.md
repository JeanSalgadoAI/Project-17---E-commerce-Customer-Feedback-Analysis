# Project 17: Customer Feedback Analysis in E-commerce

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer feedback in an e-commerce store. The main objective is to understand customer sentiments, identify trends, and provide actionable insights to improve the overall customer experience, products, and services.

## Objectives
- Analyze customer feedback to understand customer sentiment.
- Identify patterns and trends related to positive, neutral, and negative feedback.
- Develop a sentiment analysis model to categorize feedback automatically.
- Provide recommendations for enhancing customer satisfaction based on insights from the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset is simulated to represent customer feedback data in an e-commerce context. It includes features such as customer comments, product ratings, and support interactions.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming text data using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding customer feedback distribution and sentiment trends.
- **Modeling:** Using logistic regression to classify customer feedback sentiment.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrix.

## Results
The sentiment analysis model achieved strong performance in categorizing customer feedback, with insights such as:
- High satisfaction levels reflected in positive feedback (60% of total feedback).
- Neutral feedback indicating potential areas for minor improvements (20% of total feedback).
- Negative feedback highlighting critical issues to address (20% of total feedback).

## Key Insights
- Most feedback is positive, indicating good customer satisfaction.
- Neutral feedback suggests areas where customer experience can be enhanced.
- Negative feedback points to specific issues that need immediate attention to prevent customer churn.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to illustrate sentiment trends and model performance, such as:
- Confusion Matrix: To evaluate model accuracy.
- ROC Curve: To visualize model performance.
- Distribution Plot: To show the distribution of feedback sentiments.
